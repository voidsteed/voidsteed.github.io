I feel like something is missing during busy work, I’m just keep working and coding, but I never have a place to express my feeling about lots of things happened in the past and show people who may encounter some problems, and looking for a solution. For those reason, I picked up this blog again and gave it a shot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had never been a good writer, to be frankly, I’m a shitty writer. I don’t have practices to organize my thoughts and putting them into sentences. This is a practice, a grind for me to rethink myself at my 30s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe nobody will look at this blog, it is fine and I won’t expect anything. But I will continue to write something even little things to produce something in the internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wish me luck!&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Hello World]]></title><description><![CDATA[This is my first post on my new blog! How exciting!
