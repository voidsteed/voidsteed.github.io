description: a lazy man without goals starts writing like a noob

Recently, I'm trying to get myself busier and so I start working on converting some ideas to side projects. I feel like something is missing during busy work, I'm just keep working and coding, but I never have a place to express my feeling about lots of things happened in the past and show people who may encounter some problems, and looking for a solution. For those reason, I picked up this blog again and gave it a shot.

I had never been a good writer, to be frankly, I'm a shitty writer. I don't have practices to organize my thoughts and putting them into sentences. This is a practice, a grind for me to rethink myself at my 30s.

I believe nobody will look at this blog, it is fine and I won't expect anything. But I will continue to write something even little things to produce something in the internet.

Wish me luck!
