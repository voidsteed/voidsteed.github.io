Recently I've been working with several other people to developing softwares. And I finally realized how important software collaboration is.

I usually work with fairly big companies, and I have no idea how good and expensive each software cost for small startups.

Here is the list that what we need to use:

1. SwaggerHub

- We use SwaggerHub for early stage API design and schema, it was fine for just solo developer or just one person working on api, but when 2, 3 or more people are trying to use it and not willing to pay the fee, it was kinda disaster:
  - It was too hard for me to edit something: because of we didn't have paid version, I have to copy the YAML file to my editor and do some changes and then paste back to SwaggerHub to compile to generate in their UI. It is too much work for me and I think we should have paid version but it was just for api documentation, it doesn't hurt we don't have the api documentation in current stage(3 developers), so I didn't end up use it that much.

2. Monday.com

- Project management software is essential for a software team. We first used Monday.com and first several weeks it went well, and our PM didn't see anything wrong with it until one day PM just told us we can't use it anymore. It seemed it has a free trail period and we didn't realize it. the standard version's pricing is so expensive, \$10 per person? Hell no for us. We just bootstrap the project and didn't have funding yet. Then we switched to Asana. I will let you know how it goes.

3. Postman

- Postman is so nice to use for API stuff, but only solo. Now we have a team of at least 3 are writing code. It will cost us \$12/person(annually) to collabrate with each other. Not that bad, but we want to use as much as free version stuff until we get the funding. So what I can do is the export the workspace as JSON file and share with others for now.
